# Project 12: Attack the Bank

In this project we will learn how to think like an attacker and find vulnerabilities in 3 different smart contracts.

You can follow along [with the video to learn more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOdYZSe1uhE&t=20615s). We recommend creating a separate github repository for each project and commiting your code as you follow along.
